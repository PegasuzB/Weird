Well, for now I don't know anything to write here so I'll leave just this text.

So it's second lesson now and I completed 5 tasks successfully. I think I begin to understand a thing or two.

Today is third lesson and I did 10 tasks. Btw there are some easter eggs if you are interested in them.

Week 4 was kinda weird(hehe) and I came to class after 30 minutes. I participated in Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament in campus and got 4th place. I got Red Bull 0.25 l from it.So far I completed 9 of today's tasks and I'll try to complete latters later.

I forgor to update README in week 5

I forgor to update README in week 6

I know I didn't do much today buuuuuut, I really, really, really like the snippet I wrote today. It is almost perfect code. I was so amazed of myself that I couldn't do other tasks. Even though they were exactly the same task but name of the variables were changed. Kinda-ish.
