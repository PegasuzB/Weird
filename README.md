Well, for now I don't know anything to write here so I'll leave just this text.

So it's second lesson now and I completed 5 tasks successfully. I think I begin to understand a thing or two.

Today is third lesson and I did 10 tasks. Btw there are some easter eggs if you are interested in them.

Week 4 was kinda weird(hehe) and I came to class after 30 minutes. I participated in Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament in campus and got 4th place. I got Red Bull 0.25 l from it.So far I completed 9 of today's tasks and I'll try to complete latters later.
